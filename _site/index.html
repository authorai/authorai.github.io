<p>At AuthorAI we are reimagining the authoring experience powered by AI. We are exploring how state of the art in AI can enhance the creative authoring flow as it applies to creating apps, books, blogs, sites, data, designs, reports, etc.</p>

<p>To get started install the AuthorAI package for your Python project or Jupyter Notebook.</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>pip install authorai
</code></pre></div></div>

<h3 id="authorai-blogger">AuthorAI Blogger</h3>
<p>We created AuthorAI Blogger for human and AI in partnership for low-code blog authoring automation. We are sharing a <a href="https://github.com/authorai/authorai/blob/main/blogger_tutorial.ipynb">notebook tutorial</a> so that you can join the exploration. The tutorial walks through basics of AuthorAI + human authoring flow which you can adapt to your needs. Another objective of this notebook is to act as an interactive playground for the AuthorAI library.</p>

<p>Here is an example of a 100% auto generated blog post by just providing three keywords as input to AuthorAI API.</p>

<p>You can auto generate this blog post in a single API call like so.</p>

<h3 id="authorai-blogger-for-jekyll">AuthorAI Blogger for Jekyll</h3>
<p>Jekyll is one of the most popular static website generators used among GitHub community. AuthorAI now integrates with Jekyll to generate posts straight into your Jekyll managed static website. See <a href="https://github.com/authorai/authorai/blob/main/blogger-jekyll.ipynb">notebook</a> used by human author to generate a Jekyll blog post including code snippets, FAQ, multiple sections, and feature image.</p>

<p>Writing high quality blog posts is a difficult and time consuming task. It requires a great deal of effort and dedication to create content that is both interesting and informative. It is not enough to simply write a few sentences and post them online; the content must be well-researched, well-written, and engaging. It also requires a good understanding of the topic, as well as the ability to craft a compelling narrative. Additionally, the blog post must be optimized for search engines, which requires an understanding of SEO principles. Finally, the post must be edited and proofread to ensure accuracy and clarity. All of these steps take time and effort, but the end result is worth it.</p>

<p>We created AuthorAI to help the bloggers, the writers, and the authors to <strong>enhance the creative authoring flow, while leaving the plumbing to the AI</strong>. AuthorAI Blogger API was used to generate most of the content for this post. A human author provided the <em>prompts</em> to guide the AI to generate the content. Then based on the content generated the author could research the topic, structure the content appropriately, and generate the post. The post was then edited to add interleaving content to support the intended objective. The human author used a Jupyter Notebook to ideate, research, structure, and generate the content starting with following import statement. They go on to create a blog post object. Next setup the concept or idea which we want to describe as the introductory topic you just read. Then call <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">blogger.describe_concept()</code> API to generate the topic with appropriate grade level English. Finally, they set the topic in the blog post object for publishing.</p>
